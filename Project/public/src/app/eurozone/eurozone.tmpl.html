                <h1>About our Data</h1>
                <p>For the 70 percent of the world's poor who live in rural areas, agriculture is the main source of income and employment. But depletion and degradation of land and water pose serious challenges to producing enough food and other agricultural
                    products to sustain livelihoods here and meet the needs of urban populations. Data presented here include measures of agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization</p>
                <h3>Here you will see some usefull informations about the graphs</h3>
                <h1>Bar Chart</h1>
                <p>Bar charts have a discrete range. Bar charts are usually scaled so that all the data can fit on the chart. Bars on the chart may be arranged in any order. Bar charts arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called Pareto charts. Normally,
                    bars showing frequency will be arranged in chronological (time) sequence. Bar graphs/charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data.[4] Categorical data is a grouping of data into discrete groups, such as months of the year,
                    age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually qualitative. In a column bar chart, the categories appear along the horizontal axis; the height of the bar corresponds to the value of each category. Grouped or stacked[edit]
                    Bar graphs can also be used for more complex comparisons of data with grouped bar charts and stacked bar charts.[4] In a grouped bar chart, for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent
                    a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would
                    show the revenue. Alternatively, a stacked bar chart could be used. The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However,
                    stacked bar charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable. Grouped bar graphs usually present the information in the same order in each grouping. Stacked bar
                    graphs present the information in the same sequence on each bar.

                <h1>line Chart</h1>
                <p>Best-fit[edit] A parody line graph published in 1919. Charts often include an overlaid mathematical function depicting the best-fit trend of the scattered data. This layer is referred to as a best-fit layer and the graph containing this
                    layer is often referred to as a line graph. It is simple to construct a "best-fit" layer consisting of a set of line segments connecting adjacent data points; however, such a "best-fit" is usually not an ideal representation of the
                    trend of the underlying scatter data for the following reasons: It is highly improbable that the discontinuities in the slope of the best-fit would correspond exactly with the positions of the measurement values. It is highly unlikely
                    that the experimental error in the data is negligible, yet the curve falls exactly through each of the data points. In either case, the best-fit layer can reveal trends in the data. Further, measurements such as the gradient or the
                    area under the curve can be made visually, leading to more conclusions or results from the data. A true best-fit layer should depict a continuous mathematical function whose parameters are determined by using a suitable error-minimization
                    scheme, which appropriately weights the error in the data values. Such curve fitting functionality is often found in graphing software or spreadsheets. Best-fit curves may vary from simple linear equations to more complex quadratic,
                    polynomial, exponential, and periodic curves.[4]

                <h1>Scatter plot</h1>
                <p>A scatter plot can be used either when one continuous variable that is under the control of the experimenter and the other depends on it or when both continuous variables are independent. If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented
                    and/or decremented by the other, it is called the control parameter or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If
                    no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables. A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of
                    correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval. For example, weight and height, weight would be on y axis and height would be on the x axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated).
                    If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation.
                    A line of best fit (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn in order to study the relationship between the variables. An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures.
                    For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as linear regression and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time. No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary
                    relationships. A scatter plot is also very useful when we wish to see how two comparable data sets agree with each other. In this case, an identity line, i.e., a y=x line, or an 1:1 line, is often drawn as a reference. The more the
                    two data sets agree, the more the scatters tend to concentrate in the vicinity of the identity line; if the two data sets are numerically identical, the scatters fall on the identity line exactly. One of the most powerful aspects of
                    a scatter plot, however, is its ability to show nonlinear relationships between variables. The ability to do this can be enhanced by adding a smooth line such as LOESS.[5] Furthermore, if the data are represented by a mixture model
                    of simple relationships, these relationships will be visually evident as superimposed patterns. The scatter diagram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control.[6] Scatter charts can be built in the form of bubble, marker, or/and
                    line charts.[7]
